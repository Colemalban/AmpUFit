<h1>Feel good about your body again</h1>
<p class="lead">There are nearly 2 million people living with limb loss in the United States. Limb loss can lead to chronic pain due to certain joints having to carry extra stress and loads. Regular exercise can help to both strengthen and retrain your muscles. Unfortunately, viable workout plans are difficult to find. Our goal at AmpUFit is to help you overcome some of your daily challenges and to get you moving again. Through crowdsourcing, AmpUFit makes it easy for those suffering from disabilities, permanent or temporary, to stay active. We endeavor to connect you to your peers and to create a beneficial environment. Get started today and connect with your fellow AmpUFitters!</p>
